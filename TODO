Things I want
=============

Wider testing
--------------
Test in other environments

* Specify a few different ones with Nix.
* Some sort of BSD
* Windows

Packaging
------------
Package for package managers.

* I want NixOS, of course.
* Debian is probably the big one.

Other interesting package managers

* Update the npm package
* Homebrew (for Mac)

Windows
----------
Try running Urchin in Windows somehow. Interpreters include

* CygWin (https://www.cygwin.com/)
* MSYS (http://mingw.org/wiki/msys)
* GNU on Windows (https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki)
* Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* win-bash (http://win-bash.sourceforge.net/)

shall
----------
Add shall to my NYC*BUG talk.

    #!/usr/bin/env shall
    echo This runs in several shells.

Linters
-----------
List some shell linters somewhere.

* ShellCheck
* checkbashisms


Set parallel and series
----------
I want to be able to make only some directories run in series.

* Rename .urchin to .urchin_root.
* Look for a .urchin_dir file.
* If .urchin_dir contains "series", run that directory in series rather
  than in parallel.

Rename to something other than "test"?
----------
Maybe wait until I have a use for this.
