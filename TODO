Things I want
=============

Molly guard
-------------
The Molly-guard should be more accepting so that people don't have to use it
all the time and thus get used to using it. For example, you shouldn't need to
pass -f in this case.

Test speed
-------------
Make tests run faster.
https://github.com/bike-barn/hermit/issues/62

First, easier thing is probably to run tests in parallel.

Second, also easier thing is to tell people to save things to RAM rather than
disk whenever they can.

Third, harder thing is to put the test suite in RAM automatically. Maybe the
whole test directory, which includes fixtures, gets copied to a tmpfs if one
exists.

Hmm or maybe there's a compromise: Tell people to mount /tmp as a tmpfs so
that temp files are fast. Maybe allow people to set some other directory as
the temporary file place, in case they want a different tmpfs location.

Options
-------------
I want long options. For example, there's presently -f and -e.
I want to make them -f|--force and -e|--exit.

Environment variables
-------------
Do something to make it easier to debug environment variables, because that is
often confusing.
https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/719
https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/589

Documenting that people should run "env" when their tests fail might be good
enough.

Licensing and copyright
------------------------
* Reference all owners and years in the Copyright file
* Consider copyleft licenses
* Add license notices to other files if necessary

Packaging
------------
Package for package managers.

* I want NixOS, of course.
* Debian is probably the big one.

Other interesting package managers

* Update the npm package
* Homebrew (for Mac)
