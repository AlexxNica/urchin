Things I want
=============

Environment variables
-------------
Do something to make it easier to debug environment variables, because that is
often confusing.

Documenting that people should run "env" when their tests fail might be good
enough.

Packaging
------------
Package for package managers.

* I want NixOS, of course.
* Debian is probably the big one.

Other interesting package managers

* Update the npm package
* Homebrew (for Mac)

Windows
----------
Try running Urchin in Windows somehow. Interpreters include

* CygWin (https://www.cygwin.com/)
* MSYS (http://mingw.org/wiki/msys)
* GNU on Windows (https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki)
* Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* win-bash (http://win-bash.sourceforge.net/)
