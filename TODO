Things I want
=============

Wider testing
--------------
Test in other environments

* Specify a few different ones with Nix.
* Some sort of BSD
* Windows

Packaging
------------
Package for package managers.

* I want NixOS, of course.
* Debian is probably the big one.

Other interesting package managers

* Update the npm package
* Homebrew (for Mac)

Windows
----------
Try running Urchin in Windows somehow. Interpreters include

* CygWin (https://www.cygwin.com/)
  * https://cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe
* MSYS (http://mingw.org/wiki/msys)
* GNU on Windows (https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki)
* Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  * https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.7.2.windows.1/Git-2.7.2-32-bit.exe
* win-bash (http://win-bash.sourceforge.net/)


shall
----------
Add shall to my NYC*BUG talk.

    #!/usr/bin/env shall
    echo This runs in several shells.

Linters
-----------
List some shell linters somewhere.

* ShellCheck
* checkbashisms


Rename to something other than "test"?
----------
Maybe wait until I have a use for this.

Alternatives
--------------
JSON.sh test suite

Running in multiple environments
-----------------------------------
Setup for other environments includes the following.

* Installing packages
* `touch .zshrc`
* Copy urchin and tests

Bugs
-------

* Both md5sum and md5 should be supported.
