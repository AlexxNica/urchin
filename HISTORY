General tidying

* urchin -s
* $TEST_SHELL variable with $TEST_SHELL
* $TEST_SHELL variable with urchin -sh

Set NULL_GLOB so zsh doesn't print a warning.

Before version 0.0.3
----------------------
We adjusted the input parameters so it is harder to accidentally run all executable files in you
r home directory.

We added directory-based indents.
