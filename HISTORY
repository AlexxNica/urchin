HISTORY
=======

Version 0.0.7
---------------------

### Molly-guard
The Molly-guard is now more accepting. For example, you no longer need to
pass -f in this case: https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/357

### Skipping tests
Previously, tests were run if they were executable and were otherwise marked
as skipped. Now, an executable script can indicate that it is skipped by
exiting with code 3.  For example, if a test requires some dependancy, it
might look for the dependency and then skip if it does not see the dependency.
It might look like this.

    #!/bin/sh
    if which inkscape; then
      exit 3 # status code 3 for skip
    fi
    inkscape blah blah ...

I chose status code 3 sort of arbitrarily at first, but it turns out that it
would the appropriate status code if these tests were Nagios plugins, as the
concept of skipping a test is similar to the Nagios concept of unknown service
status (https://nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html#AEN78).

### Run on a file
It is now possible to run urchin on a single file.
This occurred to me when I wanted to run

    urchin test/fast/Unit\ tests/nvm_ls_current

on the nvm tests. I wound up running this instead.

    urchin test/fast/Unit\ tests/ | grep nvm_ls_current

The Molly guard is assessed, and the corresponding setup, setup_dir,
teardown, and teardown_dir files are run in the appropriate order.

Version 0.0.6
---------------------

* Produce TAP output with the -t flag.
* Add a + sign in front of directories in the normal output so that they
  line up with non-directories.
* Display skipped tests in the normal output and in the TAP output.
* Correct some things in the documentation.
* Rearrange things in the documentation to be more clear.
* Pass the -e flag to exit urchin if any single test fails.
* Remove the undocumented, experimental -x flag now that shall exists.
* Display version number with the -v flag.
* Document why Urchin is called "Urchin"
* Update TODO
* Support mksh (Change a printf command.)
* Make long lines shorter.

These changes are made somewhat separately in the branches "exit-on-fail",
"remove-urchin-x", "tap", and "update-readme". They are rebased into one
branch, "tlevine-2016-02", for merging into "master".

Version 0.0.5
---------------------
* urchin now unsets `CDPATH`.
* The documentation for `urchin -x` was removed because it was confusing.

Version 0.0.4
---------------------
* Switch urchin -x to urchin -sh and fix some problems with it
* Documentation

Version 0.0.3
---------------------
General tidying

Run with different shells in three ways

* urchin -s
* $TEST_SHELL variable with $TEST_SHELL
* $TEST_SHELL variable with urchin -sh

Set NULL_GLOB so zsh doesn't print a warning.

Before version 0.0.3
----------------------
We adjusted the input parameters so it is harder to accidentally run all executable files in you
r home directory.

We added directory-based indents.
