HISTORY
=======

Version 0.0.6
---------------------

* Produce TAP output with the -t flag.
* Add a + sign in front of directories in the normal output so that they
  line up with non-directories.
* Display skipped tests in the normal output and in the TAP output.
* Correct some things in the documentation.
* Rearrange things in the documentation to be more clear.
* Pass the -e flag to exit urchin if any single test fails.
* Remove the undocumented, experimental -x flag now that shall exists.

These changes are made somewhat separately in the branches "exit-on-fail",
"remove-urchin-x", "tap", and "update-readme". They are rebased into one
branch, "tlevine-2016-02", for merging into "master".

Version 0.0.5
---------------------
* urchin now unsets `CDPATH`.
* The documentation for `urchin -x` was removed because it was confusing.

Version 0.0.4
---------------------
* Switch urchin -x to urchin -sh and fix some problems with it
* Documentation

Version 0.0.3
---------------------
General tidying

Run with different shells in three ways

* urchin -s
* $TEST_SHELL variable with $TEST_SHELL
* $TEST_SHELL variable with urchin -sh

Set NULL_GLOB so zsh doesn't print a warning.

Before version 0.0.3
----------------------
We adjusted the input parameters so it is harder to accidentally run all executable files in you
r home directory.

We added directory-based indents.
